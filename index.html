  <h3>The IB offers an education for students from age 3 to 19, comprising of four programmes that focus on teaching students to think critically and independently, and how to inquire with care and logic. The IB prepares students to succeed in a world where facts and fiction merge in the news, and where asking the right questions is a crucial skill that will allow them to flourish long after they’ve left our programmes. We are supported by IB teachers and coordinators who develop and promote the IB’s curriculums in almost 5,000 schools globally every day, in over 150 countries around the world.</h3>
  <h3><u>Some things ib looks out for include</u>
  <ul class="reasons">
    <li>A good G.P.A</li>
    <li>Good Attendance</li>
    <li>Your FSA scores and if you have had Ap before they also look for that.</li>
    <li>Previous years. They look at how you did in 7 grade the most since it's not to early in midlle school like 6 even though they look at 6 but 8 grade is to new so they can't see your final scores.</li>
    <li>They look at 7 like I said but specially math and science.</li>
    </li>They look what math are you doing and how well you're doing in it
  </ul>
